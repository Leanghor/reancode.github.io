                    Forests play a critical role for the global environment, 
                    population and economy. Besides alleviating the effects 
                    of climate change and natural disasters, they represent 
                    some of the richest biological areas on Earth. They also 
                    provide food, renewable raw materials for many of our 
                    products, and livelihoods for millions of people.

                        Forests can mitigate climate change. 
                        By capturing and storing carbon, 
                        forests remove significant volumes 
                        of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
                        A tree will continue to store carbon 
                        after it has been harvested and used 
                        – furniture and wooden homes can store
                         carbon for hundreds of years. That is
                          why it is so important to use wood-based 
                          products.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="t-box">
                    <p>
                        Sustainably produced wood and paper-based goods are a
                         wise, renewable and environmentally friendly choice 
                         compared to other materials such as plastics, which 
                         alone, use 4% of the total global oil production. 
                         Similarly, energy production from forest-based wood 
                         and biomass can replace other more greenhouse-gas 
                         intensive products, such as oil and coal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Forests also influence nature’s capacity to cope with 
                        natural hazards, acting as barriers against heavy rains, 
                        flooding and strong winds. They help control or reduce 
                        the risk of soil erosion, landslides and avalanches. 
                        Forests therefore have an important role in protecting 
                        the homes and communities (FAO) of animals and people, 
                        and they help to maintain the environmental conditions 
                        needed for agricultural production.
